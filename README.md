## ⚙ Installation

1.  **Install Git**  
    [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2.  **Install Python 3.x**  
    [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3.  **Install required Python packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install ftfy beautifulsoup4 chardet
    ```

4.  **Clone this repository or Download as ZIP**

5.  **Edit this line** inside `notion-sync.bat` to match your local GitHub folder (line 49):
    ```bat
    set "GITHUB_DIR=C:\GitHub\Your-Repo-Name"
    ```
6. **.gitignore is auto-generated by the script**:  
    The script will automatically create a `.gitignore` file for you (if it doesn't exist), so you usually don't need to prepare one manually. You can add extra files to ignore later if needed.The script auto-creates a `.gitignore` for `last-robocopy.log`.

7. **Exclude specific files**:  
    To always skip certain files (like constants), add them to `notion-sync.bat` (see line 53). Some common files are already excluded.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  Export your Notion workspace (as in this case) **HTML** and place the `.zip` file in your **Downloads** folder.

    - Extract & clean the export
    - Fix internal links and encoding
    - Push the updates to GitHub
    - Open your repo in browser
    - delete the original notion zip file and the temp files.
